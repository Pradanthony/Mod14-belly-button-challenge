# Mod14-belly-button-challenge
First shot at JavaScript and it was challenging!
Belly Button Biodiversity Data in JSON format was used to perform this Data Visualization task.
The data is about Microbes that colonize human navels.
D3 library was used to read the JSON file during each task.
First the hoz=rizontal bar chart for the top 10 OTU ids.
Second a Bubble chart with the Bacteria cultures per sample
Finally a Demograhic Info chart for each test subject from the drop down menu.
This was all deployed to git hub pages.
